This code demonstrates a subtle type error in TypeScript that can easily be missed.  The `add` function is declared to take two numbers as arguments, but it is called with a number and a string.  While TypeScript is designed to prevent these types of errors, in this instance, it does not, which leads to unexpected behavior during runtime.  The solution involves improving type checking using type guards or assertion.
